The connection object handles HTTP requests. You shouldn't 
have to call it directly because HBase requests are transparently 
made by the client objects.

Note, at this point, the HTTP client only communicate to 
HBase with the JSON format. Some valid requests requests return 
an empty body which of course not a valid JSON. In such cases, 
no error is thrown by the response handler but the returned value 
is null.

Creating a new connection
-------------------------

The most common way of initializing a new connection object 
is through the client object. When a new client is constructed, 
it create and hold a connection object.

```javascript
var client = hbase({ options });
assert.ok(client.connection instanceof hbase.Connection);
```

You can also manually contruct a new instance as follow:

```javascript
var connection = new hbase.Connection( client );
```

HTTP Get requests
-----------------

```javascript
myConnection.get(command, callback, [status]);
```

Execute an HTTP Get request. The callback contains 3 arguments: the error object if any, the decoded response body and the Node `http.ClientResponse` object.

```javascript
(new Connection({}))
.get('http://localhost:8080/', function(error, data, response){
  if(error){

```javascript
process.exit(1);

nsole.log('Status code: ' + response.statusCode);
nsole.log('Number of tables: ' + tables.length);
```

});
```
