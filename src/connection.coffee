###
Connection: HTTP REST requests for HBase
========================================

The connection object handles HTTP requests. You shouldn't
have to call it directly because HBase requests are transparently
made by the client objects.

Note, at this point, the HTTP client only communicate to
HBase with the JSON format. Some valid requests requests return
an empty body which of course not a valid JSON. In such cases,
no error is thrown by the response handler but the returned value
is null.

Creating a new connection
-------------------------

The most common way of initializing a new connection object
is through the client object. When a new client is constructed,
it create and hold a connection object.

```javascript
var client = hbase({ options });
assert.ok(client.connection instanceof hbase.Connection);
```

You can also manually contruct a new instance as follow:

```javascript
var connection = new hbase.Connection( client );
```
###
Connection = (client) ->
  @client = client
  return

Connection::makeRequest = (method, command, data, callback) ->
  self = this
  options =
    port: @client.options.port
    host: @client.options.host
    method: method
    path: command
    headers:
      "content-type": "application/json"
      Accept: "application/json"

  req = http.request(options, (res) ->
    body = ""
    res.on "data", (chunk) ->
      body += chunk

    res.on "end", ->
      error = null
      try
        body = self.handleJson(res, body)
      catch e
        body = null
        error = e
      callback error, body, res

    res.on "close", ->
      e = new Error("Connectino closed")
      callback e, null

  )
  req.on "error", (err) ->
    callback err

  if data and data isnt ""
    data = (if typeof data is "string" then data else JSON.stringify(data))
    req.write data, "utf8"
  req.end()

###
HTTP Get requests
-----------------

```javascript
myConnection.get(command, callback, [status]);
```

Execute an HTTP Get request. The callback contains 3 arguments: the error object if any, the decoded response body and the Node `http.ClientResponse` object.

```javascript
(new Connection({}))
.get('http://localhost:8080/', function(error, data, response){
  if(error){
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log('Status code: ' + response.statusCode);
  console.log('Number of tables: ' + tables.length);
});
```
###
Connection::get = (command, callback) ->
  @makeRequest "GET", command, "", callback

Connection::put = (command, data, callback) ->
  @makeRequest "PUT", command, data, callback

Connection::post = (command, data, callback) ->
  @makeRequest "POST", command, data, callback

Connection::delete = (command, callback) ->
  @makeRequest "DELETE", command, "", callback

Connection::handleJson = (response, body) ->
  switch response.statusCode
    # Created
    when 201, 200 # Ok
      (if body then JSON.parse(body) else null)
    else
      e = new Error(response.statusCode + ": " + @codes[response.statusCode])
      e.code = response.statusCode
      e.body = body
      throw e
